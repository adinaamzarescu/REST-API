____________________________________________________________________________

This is the third University Project for the Communication Protocols course.

The idea of this project is a client that interacts with a REST API.

Objectives:
• understanding the mechanisms of communication over HTTP
• Interaction with a REST API
• Understanding the concepts often used in the web such as JSON, session, JWT

Mentions:
  * I have used the 10th laboratory (HTTP) as skel for this project.
      * I have changed the requests.c, requests.h and client.c files
  * I have added stdout messages in order to make the project more
    aesthetically.
      * Examples: "This is not a valid command", "Please enter a command:"
      * I also added new lines in order to make the output intelligible.
